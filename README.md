Passed DP-300 exam. Tips, Resources and Practice Tests

just passed the dp-300 (azure database administrator) exam and thought i‚Äôd share my prep experience for anyone considering it. definitely not the easiest exam ‚Äî it goes deep into managing, securing, optimizing, and automating sql server workloads on azure. not just theory, but practical stuff like backup strategies, high availability, performance tuning, and role-based access control.

i started with a mix of microsoft learn modules and some youtube videos for basics. the microsoft learning path is decent but a bit dry in places. what really helped me was the skillcertpro practice tests ‚Äî a colleague had mentioned them and i decided to give them a try. honestly, i was surprised how close they were to the actual exam format. the questions were mostly scenario-based and covered iaas vs paas deployments, monitoring, t-sql, and alerting quite well. i saw about 70-80% of questions in the actual test that were very similar to what i practiced.

i prepped for about 3 weeks ‚Äî 1 week for videos and learning, then 2 weeks just doing mock tests, reviewing what i got wrong, and making notes. their cheat sheet was super helpful the night before ‚Äî it summarizes key concepts in a really quick and easy-to-review way.

if you're planning to take the exam, i'd say focus on hands-on concepts, practice questions, and understanding how to actually manage and troubleshoot in azure ‚Äî not just memorize definitions. and yeah, skillcertpro is worth trying, especially for building confidence with the format.

**‚úÖ DP-300 Exam Tips
**
Understand the difference between IaaS vs PaaS SQL offerings (SQL Server on Azure VM vs Azure SQL DB vs Managed Instance).

Practice T-SQL queries ‚Äî expect questions that require a solid grasp of SQL for managing and querying data.

Spend more time on Skillcertpro mock tests to get used to the exam pattern and question style.

Use the Microsoft Learn paths and official documentation ‚Äî hands-on experience with Azure Portal, CLI, and ARM templates is crucial.

Take notes on incorrect answers from practice tests and revise them the day before the exam.

Don‚Äôt ignore performance tuning ‚Äî you'll get questions on Query Store, execution plans, and indexes.

Know where services are configured (e.g., enabling threat detection in SQL Server, configuring Geo-replication, etc.)

Set up alerts and automation ‚Äî you should know how to automate backups, restores, scaling, and performance insights.

Understand High Availability and DR setups (Failover groups, geo-restore, auto-failover groups).

RBAC and security configuration in both portal and PowerShell/CLI will be tested.
